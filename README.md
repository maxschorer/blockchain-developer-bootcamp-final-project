<h1>Crypto Quarters</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In the late 1990s, the US mint started a program where they released limited editions quarters for all 50 states [link](https://www.usmint.gov/learn/kids/about-the-mint/50-state-quarters) over the next decade.  They also released a cardboard map of the United States that could hold all 50 quarters, and my family steadily collected these quarters over time until we got all 50.</p>

<p>I'd like to build the NFT version of that.  But instead of releasing [400M-1.6B of each state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_State_quarters), I'd release significantly less.</p>

<h2>Initial Release</h2>
<p>First, I'll start with one state, probably California since it has the highest crypto adoption and it's where I live.  I'd mint exactly 11,111 California quarters with the following tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>10,000 Bronze</li>
<li>1,000 Silver</li>
<li>100 Gold</li>
<li>10 Diamond</li>
<li>1 Orange</li>
</ul>   

<p>Except for the colored tier, the design would be identical for each quarter except for a serial number.  For example, assuming I used the current California quarter design (note: I don't like the California quarter design, so I'm hoping somebody on 99Designs can make something better), this is what Diamond 7 would look like.</p>

<p>In other words, each NFT would have the following three properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>US State</li>
<li>Tier</li>
<li>Serial Number</li>
</ol>

Similar to CryptoPunks, for the first release, I'd keep it simple and let anybody grab a token and then people can trade/resell from there.  One caveat is I'd intend to limit each address to only own state.  Ex: if a user already has a California quarter but they want another one, their only option would be to swap for another California quarter or sell their current one before buying another.  They couldn't own more than one.
